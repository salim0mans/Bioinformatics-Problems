    "## 5.GC - Computing GC Content\n",
    "  \n",
    "We start by uploading the file from a local directory or so. \n",
    "  First we define the general proccessing function that will calculate the GC percentage rounding to 6 digits. Then, we define another function that correctly reads the contents of the file (they were intentionally put as an ID line and then a sequence cut in separate lines (not one line as usual). Therefore, the manipulate function takes the lines that define the ID (as they start with \">\"), then takes in a loop all the lines that don't start with \">\", and concatenate them to reform one line until it finds \">\" again, which refers to beginning a new sequence. So, in this case the second condition applies and calculates the GC (with our first function) and assigns it into a dictionary.  \n",
    "We end up with a dictionary of IDs as keys, and another with GC content (at the same ordera with ID) as keys. so we form a final dict from them, as ID as key and GC as value.  \n",
    "Finally we make a simple matching function to get the max GC and output it with its corresponding ID, the same format required by the site."
