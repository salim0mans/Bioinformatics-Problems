    "The idea behind this piece of code is to provide an input about the genotype of each of parents, and then outputs the probability of dominant or recessive genotypes.  \n",

    "the following is simple, we determine the case we have by calculation, and call that case dictionary (from the bigger dictionary) and sum prbability where dominant (or recessive) genotype happens, and output that total probability."
