# Bioinformatics-Problems
This Repository represents some examples of biological problems and general pipelines that are carried away by my personal code and skills. Problems are mostly in Python as my primary choice. However, R proves vital for some pipelines.

Sources of problems include:
  1. ROSALIND - Bioinformatics Stronghold.
  2. Coursera - Introduction to Bioinformatics (chapter 1).
  3. Single-Cell RNA-seq general pipeline with basic QC, conducted on public data.
